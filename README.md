# Code for URCL

A simplified code of Our ICDE24 paper: A Unified Replay-based Continuous Learning Framework for Spatio-Temporal Prediction on Streaming Data

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pytorch 1.6
- Numpy

## Data Preparation
URCL is implemented on several public correlated time series forecasting datasets.

- **METR-LA** and **PEMS-BAY** from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10FOTa6HXPqX8Pf5WRoRwcFnW9BrNZEIX) or [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/14Yy9isAIZYdU__OYEQGa_g) links provided by [DCRNN](https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN)

- **PEMS04** and **PEMS08** from [STSGCN (AAAI-20)](https://github.com/Davidham3/STSGCN).
